This is a project i did with my buddy in the 3rd semester of university for a Web related course so we used the trinity HTML, css and javascript for it. It pulls movies from The Movie Database (TMDB) by API calls where it sorts movies by genre and has a searching functionality with a homepage to display all that plus there is also a simple Forum section also.
